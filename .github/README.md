# 444B Personal Development Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to my Personal Development repository, an exploratory project where I apply the principles of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to my personal growth journey. Inspired by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, this project navigates the delicate balance between measuring performance and making an impact in personal development.

### The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in Personal Development
> It is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact velocity of a particle. In other words, the more accurately you try to measure one property, the less accurately you can measure the other.  

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle posits that it's impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact velocity of a particle with absolute precision. This concept metaphorically applies to personal development as well: the more we focus on quantifying our progress (measuring performance), the less we may actually engage in meaningful growth activities (making an impact), and vice versa. This is due to the inherent limitations on an individual's time and energy, suggesting a zero-sum game between these two aspects.

### Project Objective

This repository serves as a thought experiment and a practical application space where I aim to:
- Track and measure my personal OKRs and KPIs.
- Find a sustainable balance between performance measurement and impactful actions.
- Utilize GitHub's ecosystem (Issues, Projects, Milestones) to document and manage my personal development goals.

## Navigating This Repository
