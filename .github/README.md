> ### The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
> It is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact velocity of a particle. In other words, the more accurately you try to measure one property, the less accurately you can measure the other.  

Perhaps the same might be said for tracking Impact and Performance of individuals through KPIs and OKRs. The more effort is spent on quantifying the performance of an individual, the less effort is spent on making an impact since both require time and effort.
The reason for this is that there is a zum-zero sum zero game with regards to the individuals time and energy as both have limits.  

Welcome to my thought experiment where I try to measure my own OKRs and KPIs of my personal life and find a balance between doing work and signalling that work is being done, both of which are important to manage.  

You can see my current initiatives and goals is this repos [Issues](https://github.com/444B/personal-development/issues)  
You can see the overall progress of my project in [Milestones](https://github.com/444B/personal-development/milestones) and as a [Project](https://github.com/444B/personal-development/projects) 

The background and context of this project is my aiming towards GitHubs new [Certifications](https://resources.github.com/learn/certifications/) and finding a practical use for the skills learned
